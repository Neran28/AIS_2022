\ex{Shader abstraction}{15}

Reuse your submission for assignment 3 as your codebase for this assignment.
In the previous assignments a lot of repetitive code had to be written for creating different shader programs. This can be tedious if there are a lot of programs to handle and its a good idea to abstract this into a class.
\\
\\
In this assignment your task is to create a class named \texttt{GLProgram} which abstracts the complete process from creating a vertex and fragment shader from files to linking them into a program. The class should also include calls for using a program, retrieving attribute and uniform locations and setting shader uniforms. For further details look at the class diagram below \ref{fig:class_diagram}. Make sure to implement all the public methods. You can reuse the code inside the \texttt{GLHelper} class for compiling and creating the shaders from files.

Also rewrite your \texttt{main.cpp} file by replacing shader and program calls with functionality of the newly created \texttt{GLProgram} class. Make sure that your program compiles and that the rendering of the program still matches the result of Assignment03.
